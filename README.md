## Inspiration & Acknowledgements

Mago stands on the shoulders of giants. Our design and functionality are heavily inspired by pioneering tools in both the Rust and PHP ecosystems.

### Inspirations:

- [Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy): For its comprehensive linting approach.
- [OXC](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/): A major inspiration for building a high-performancetoolchain in Rust.
- [Hakana](https://github.com/slackhq/hakana/): For its deep static analysis capabilities.

### Acknowledgements:

We deeply respect the foundational work of tools like [PHP-CS-Fixer](https://github.com/PHP-CS-Fixer/PHP-CS-Fixer), [Psalm](https://github.com/vimeo/psalm), [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan), and [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer). While Mago aims to offer a unified and faster alternative, these tools paved the way for modern PHP development.
