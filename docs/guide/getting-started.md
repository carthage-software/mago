# Getting started ðŸš€

Welcome to **Mago**! You're about to experience a new level of speed and precision in PHP development tooling.

**Mago** is a complete toolchain for PHP, written in Rust, designed from the ground up for maximum performance. It includes:

- **A blazing-fast [formatter](../tools/formatter/overview.md)** that automatically formats your code according to PSR-12, ending style debates forever.
- **An intelligent [linter](../tools/linter/overview.md)** that catches stylistic issues, inconsistencies, and code smells before they become problems.
- **A powerful static [analyzer](../tools/analyzer/overview.md)** that finds type errors and logical bugs in your code without you ever having to run it.

This guide will walk you through installing Mago and setting it up for your project in just a few minutes.

### Next steps
