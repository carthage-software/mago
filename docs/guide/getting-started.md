# Getting Started ðŸš€

Welcome to **Mago**! You're about to experience a new level of speed and precision in PHP development tooling.

**Mago** is a complete toolchain for PHP, written in Rust, designed from the ground up for maximum performance. It includes:

- A blazing-fast [formatter](/tools/formatter/overview.md) that automatically formats your code according to PER-CS, ending style debates forever.
- An intelligent [linter](/tools/linter/overview.md) that catches stylistic issues, inconsistencies, and code smells before they become problems.
- A powerful static [analyzer](/tools/analyzer/overview.md) that finds type errors and logical bugs in your code without you ever having to run it.
- A robust [architectural guard](/tools/guard/overview.md) that enforces dependency rules and structural conventions.

This guide will walk you through installing Mago and setting it up for your project in just a few minutes.
