# Formatter Settings

Mago’s formatter can be configured to suit your project’s needs. Instead of maintaining a static list of settings here, we recommend referring to the official and always up-to-date documentation.

For the latest available settings and their descriptions, please visit: [FormatSettings Documentation](https://docs.rs/mago-formatter/latest/mago_formatter/settings/struct.FormatSettings.html)

This page contains the most current list of formatter options, their default values, and examples of usage. Since the settings evolve over time, checking the Rust documentation ensures you always have the latest information.

The default settings are designed to work well for most projects, and adhere to the [PER Coding Style 2.0](https://www.php-fig.org/per/coding-style/) coding standard,
but you can customize them to match your preferred coding style.
