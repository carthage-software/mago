# Command reference

The `mago ast` command is a powerful inspection tool that tokenizes and parses a single PHP file, giving you insight into its lexical and syntactical structure.

```sh
Usage: mago ast [OPTIONS] <FILE>
```

## Arguments

### `<FILE>`

**Required.** The path to the single PHP file you want to inspect.

## Options

### `--tokens`

Display the stream of raw tokens generated by the lexer instead of the parsed AST. This is useful for debugging low-level syntax issues. This can be combined with `--json` for machine-readable output.

### `--json`

Display the output (either the AST or the token stream) in a machine-readable, pretty-printed JSON format. This is ideal for integration with other tools and scripts.

### `--names`

After parsing the AST, this flag runs the name resolver and prints a list of all symbols (classes, functions, etc.) and their fully qualified names. This is useful for debugging namespace and import resolution.

### `-h`, `--help`

Print the help summary for the command.
